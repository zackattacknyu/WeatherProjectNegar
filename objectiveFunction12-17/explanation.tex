Let $f$ be the error function which we are trying to prove is the best one.\\
Let $g$ be the other error function.\\
Let $p(A,B)$ be the probability of choosing patch A over patch B.\\
Let $X$ and $Y$ be our two patches.\\
\\
We will focus on examples where $f$ and $g$ predict different patches, \\
thus without loss of generality,\\
$f(X) < f(Y)$ and $g(X) > g(Y)$\\
\\
Let $H_1 = f(Y)-f(X)$ and $H_2 = g(X)-g(Y)$\\
Let $H = H_1 + \alpha H_2$ ($\alpha$ will be chosen so that $H_1$ and $\alpha H_2$ have the same range)\\
\\
Assumption 1: If $f$ is a good error function, then the $H_1$ value is correlated with our confidence that $X$ is a better patch than $Y$.\\
\\
Using assumption 1, I will sort the examples by $H_1$ in descending order. The probability of choosing $X$ over $Y$ should be very high in the initial examples and decrease as you progress through the examples. Thus $H_1$ and $p(X,Y)$ should be well correlated.\\
\\
I will then sort by $H_2$ in descending order and show the examples. If $f$ outperforms $g$ then we should find that $p(Y,X)$ and $H_2$ are not as well correlated as $p(X,Y)$ and $H_1$.  \\
\\
Assumption 2: If $f$ is a better error function than $g$, then $X$ should be better than $Y$ for the examples where they disagree the most.\\
\\
To formalize assumption 2, I will sort the examples by descending order of $H$ value. For the first $m$ examples, there should be a very high probability of choosing $X$ over $Y$. I will then flip the definition of $f$ and $g$ and show examples in descending order of $H$ value. The average probability of choosing $X$ over $Y$ for these first $m$ examples should be lower than previously.
